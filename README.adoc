= nRF51-ble-broadcast-mesh

Bluetooth Low Energy based Rebroadcasting mesh implementation on the nRF51.
Works with Softdevice S110 v7.x with Timeslot API (tested), likely to work with
S120 and S130 softdevices (not tested). Support for both SDK6.x.x and SDK7.x.x as of release v0.6.1.
Offers an API for implementing your own mesh enabled application, operating
concurrently with regular BLE applications.

== About
This project was created in collaboration with The Norwegian University of 
Science and Technology (NTNU), as part of a master thesis. The project is not
part of the official Nordic Semiconductor SDK. Developers are welcome to contribute
and provide feedback.

== Usage
In addition to two provided examples, there is a template project under
_nRF51/examples/_. This may be used as a basis for your own applications, or you
could choose to do it yourself from scratch. In theory, the framework should be
compatible with most Softdevice based projects, but some restrictions to
hardware and software modules apply, see link:docs/how_it_works.adoc#resource-allocation[Resource allocation]  for details.
The framework adds a Mesh GATT service to the Softdevice GATT server which
contain all mesh-global states. This service may be accessed by external nodes,
just as any other GATT service, through a connection established via the
Softdevice. See section link:docs/how_it_works.adoc#gatt-service[GATT service] for details about structure and
access. 

=== Serial interface

The framework also has support for external control via SPI. The serial interface is based on the nRF8001 SPI interface, with different opcodes. An application controller framework is avilable under _application_controller_, with an Arduino example to get you started. Note that the application controller requires the https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/ble-sdk-arduino[ble-sdk-arduino] framework. This allows you to operate an Arduino along with an nRF51 dev kit in the mesh, making it easier to create mesh applications. Each nRF51 example project has a separate target (named "nRF51822 xxAA serial") that incorporates the serial interface with the rest of the project.

=== Getting started

The framework supports both nRF51 SDK 6.x.x and nRF51 SDK 7.x.x. Since the structure of the SDK changed between these versions, you have to clone the repo differently based on which version you utilize.

If you're using 6.x.x, clone the repository into _<SDK6-folder>/nRF51822/boards/PCA10001/S110/<Project-folder>_. 

The SDK 7.x.x projects utilizes the *non-pack* version of the SDK, available at http://developer.nordicsemi.com/[Nordic Semiconductor's developer portal]. Clone this repo into _<SDK7-folder>/examples/<Project-folder>_. 

This will ensure that all references to the SDK are correctly placed, so that you don't have to change all references to the SDK in the project files. If you still want to clone the repo into a different folder than suggested, you need to change the location of all the files under the _Lib_ group in Keil uVision, in addition to the include paths under the menu _Target options -> C/C++ -> Include Paths_.

=== Integrating with existing applications
The framework is built to be compatible with most existing SDK example projects, and we've written a short guide to include it in existing projects with as few changes to existing code as possible. The guide uses the ble_app_proximity example from the SDK as reference, and shows a step by step approach to overcoming typical problems with integration:

== Basic concepts

A rebroadcasting mesh network works by flooding all messages to all nodes 
in the network through broadcasts. Each time a device receives a broadcast
message from some other device in the mesh, it repeats the message, or 
_rebroadcasts_ it, letting its neighbors hear the new message. 
The neighbors rebroadcast the message to their neighbors, and the process
is repeated until all devices in the mesh have received the message. This 
lets wireless devices talk to eachother without being within direct radio 
range, as devices between them help relaying the messages.

The Rebroadcasting Mesh framework (hereby referred to as "the framework" or
rbc_mesh) provides a connection-less, rebroadcasting infrastructure for
synchronizing states across a set of BLE enabled nodes. All nodes receive all
messages that are transmitted within their range, and any node may update the
mesh-global states. There is no hierarchy, and no directed data links. 

The framework resides on top of the nRF51 Softdevice, utilizing the Timeslot
API to allocate radio time. The framework will attempt to allocate as much time
as possible, in order to listen for other nodes' messages.

All nodes in the mesh share a set of indexed dataslots. The data contained at each
index is propagated through the mesh with version numbers, with the objective of 
synchronizing the same version of the data across all nodes in the mesh. Each 
time a node overwrites a value, it increments the version number, and all nodes 
that receive a broadcast message with a version number that is higher than the 
one in its database, will adapt this new version of the value. 

The value propagation is controlled by an implementation of the IETF RFC6206
"Trickle", a flood control algorithm for lossy, low power networks. The Trickle
algorithm dynamically decides intervals at which a value will be broadcasted by
a node, based on how many consistent messages the node picks up, and when the last
update to the state it manages was. The Trickle algorithm dynamically adapts to
node density and value update frequency.

The framework provides each handle-value pair with one Trickle-instance (an
isolated version of the algorithm), and utilizes the Softdevice GATT server
structure to store the values. All values are stored as characteristics within
one "Mesh"-GATT Service, which is accessible to external nodes through a
classic BLE Softdevice connection, implemented in application space. The "BLE
Gateway example" displays a way to achieve such behavior.
