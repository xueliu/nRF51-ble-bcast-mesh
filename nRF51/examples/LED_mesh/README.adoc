= LED example 
\- A basic mesh node application

This example application displays a very basic mesh node implementation, where
two value-handle pairs are used to control LEDs on the hardware board. The
example reacts to GPIO button input as well as external commands sent through a board
flashed with the BLE Gateway example.

The example is made for nRF51x22 Evaluation and Development kits (PCA10000,
PCA10001, PCA10003, both dongles and boards), and the two
characteristics provided in the mesh Service represents LED 0 and LED 1 on the
board, and RGB RED and GREEN on the dongles.
